# Dashboard API Optimization - Preventing Excessive API Calls

## Problem Identified
The dashboard page was hitting Supabase rate limits due to excessive API requests being fired. After investigation, it was determined that while no explicit polling mechanisms were found, the React Query configuration and component behavior could lead to unnecessary API calls.

## Changes Made

### 1. React Query Client Configuration (App.tsx)
- **Reduced retries**: Changed from 2 to 1 retry to prevent excessive retry attempts
- **Disabled automatic refetching**: 
  - `refetchOnMount: false` - Prevents refetch on component mount
  - `refetchOnReconnect: false` - Prevents refetch on network reconnect
- **Increased cache times**:
  - `staleTime: 30 minutes` (was 5 minutes)
  - `gcTime: 60 minutes` (was 10 minutes)
- **Added network mode**: `networkMode: 'online'` to prevent duplicate requests

### 2. Dashboard Page Queries (DashboardPage.tsx)
- **Disabled automatic refetching**: All queries now have `refetchOnMount: false`
- **Infinite stale time**: `staleTime: Infinity` ensures data stays fresh until manual refresh
- **Infinite cache time**: `gcTime: Infinity` keeps data in cache indefinitely
- **Manual refresh only**: Data is only fetched when explicitly requested

### 3. Initial Data Loading Strategy
- **Manual initial fetch**: Added useEffect to manually trigger initial data fetch only once
- **Conditional loading**: Data is only fetched when user is authenticated and no data exists
- **Prevents duplicate calls**: Ensures each query is only called once on initial load

### 4. Refresh Function Improvements
- **Debouncing**: Added 100ms delay to prevent rapid successive API calls
- **Cooldown protection**: Refresh button is disabled during loading states
- **User feedback**: Clear indication when refresh is in progress

## Key Benefits

1. **Reduced API Calls**: Data is fetched only once on page load and manual refresh
2. **Better Rate Limit Management**: No automatic background refetching
3. **Improved Performance**: Longer cache times reduce unnecessary network requests
4. **Better User Experience**: Clear feedback and protection against rapid clicking

## API Call Pattern

**Before**: Multiple automatic refetches, retries, and background updates
**After**: 
- Initial load: 3 API calls (dashboard stats, recent orders, recent users)
- Manual refresh: 3 API calls (only when user clicks refresh button)
- No automatic background calls

## Monitoring

The changes maintain all existing logging and error handling while significantly reducing the number of API calls. Users can still manually refresh data when needed, but the system no longer makes unnecessary background requests.

## Testing Recommendations

1. Verify dashboard loads with only 3 initial API calls
2. Confirm manual refresh works correctly
3. Check that no background API calls occur
4. Monitor Supabase rate limit usage
5. Test with slow network conditions
